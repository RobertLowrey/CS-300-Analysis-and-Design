# CS-300-Analysis-and-Design

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The problem at hand was to implement a data structure that would hold course information such as course number, course title, and prerequisites for individual courses. 

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I approached this problem looking at the course data that needed to be stored, and the run time analysis of the structures that could have been implemented in replace of the 2D array structure I chose. data structures are so important to understand because it impacts the runtime of the program. Meaning that some data structures will take longer to retrieve data than others. Also they are important to understand because they can collide with each other which could retrieve the wrong data.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

One roadblock that I encountered during this project was how to implement the 2D array. Coding is still a new language and skill that I am trying to master; however, practice makes perfect. Another roadblock that i encountered was that It took the whole MATH course line out of the output, and I cannot figure out why it will not show on the output. I've met with tutors and still have not been able to figure it out. Therefore, I was not able to overcome this roadblock during my research of the project. The last roadblock that I had to overcome was having a family emergency. I was away from electronics for a few days in order to travel to where I was needed. Since I'm the only one in my family with a medical background, I was needed to tend to my fathers complications. This roadblock lead me to turn in an incomplete assignment, but I was able to complete my project a couple days later after everything had calmed down in my personal life. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

This project helped me understand that you need to explore all structure options in order to have a better program as an ending result. When exploring multiple options of structures it can open doors that can potentially make the application easier to implement, and easier to maintain in the future. 

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

My work on this project has evolved the way I write programs by incorporating pseudocode first before implementing anything in my current program. The more I learn about Computer Science, the more I understand that having a pseudocode is the key to having a transparent program. In a mapping of pseudocode, you can determine what you are doing and where you are doing it. It puts everything into perspective before you even implement it. This helps others as well as yourself understand what is happening in the application. This will also help make the program more readable. Another thing that has helped me evolve is the in-line comments that are needed when developing. This helps future developers see where you were going and what your thoughts were when programming that application. This will also help future developers maintain your program and expand it if needed.
